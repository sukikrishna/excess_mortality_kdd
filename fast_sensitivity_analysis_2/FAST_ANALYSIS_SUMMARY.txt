RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FULL MODEL EVALUATION:

1. PROXY-BASED RECOMMENDATION:
   - Use 10 trials and 6 seeds for all models
   - Expected stability: CV ≈ 0.8549
   - Computational cost per model: ~60 evaluations

2. CONFIDENCE LEVEL: Medium
   - LSTM_Config2 showed improving performance
   - Other models likely to follow similar convergence patterns
   - Consider validation with 1-2 additional models if critical

3. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
   - Start with recommended parameters for full hyperparameter search
   - Monitor early results for consistency with proxy analysis
   - Adjust if other models show significantly different behavior
