==========================================

Analysis Configuration:
- Model configurations tested: 7
- Models: lstm_small, lstm_medium, lstm_large, tcn_small, tcn_medium, sarima_1, sarima_2
- Stability threshold: 0.9 (Spearman correlation)
- Reference: 50 trials, 10 seeds

Key Findings:

✓ OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION FOUND:
  - Trials: 5
  - Seeds: 1
  - Ranking stability: 0.964
  - Compute time: 86.6 seconds
  - Efficiency score: 0.011129

✓ MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:
  - Minimum trials for stability: 5
  - Minimum seeds for stability: 1
  - Total stable configurations: 95

Correlation Statistics:
- Mean correlation: 0.980
- Standard deviation: 0.028
- Range: 0.857 - 1.000
- Configurations above threshold: 95/100

Recommendations:

1. Use 5 trials and 1 seeds for hyperparameter search
2. This configuration provides stable rankings with reasonable computational cost
3. Model rankings are reliable for selecting best hyperparameters
4. Can proceed with confidence to full grid search using these parameters
