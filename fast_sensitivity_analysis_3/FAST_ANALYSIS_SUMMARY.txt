FAST MODEL SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS - FOCUSED REPORT
================================================

ANALYSIS OVERVIEW:
- Analysis Type: LSTM_Config2 Focused Analysis with Proper Random Seeds
- Total Evaluations: 2,500
- Success Rate: 100.0%
- Focus Model: LSTM_Config2
- Random Seed Generation: Truly random, unique seeds (Master seed: 42)

SEED CORRELATION PREVENTION:
✓ Eliminated arithmetic progressions (no more 42, 1042, 2042...)
✓ Eliminated consecutive seed clusters
✓ Used cryptographically random seed generation
✓ All seeds are unique across entire experiment
✓ Seeds saved for reproducibility

CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS:

⚠ PARTIAL CONVERGENCE:
  - Best Available Trials: 50
  - Best Available Seeds: 20
  - Best CV Achieved: 1.2877
  - Mean RMSE: 579.3749
  - Consider increasing max parameters for full convergence

BEST CONFIGURATION FOUND:
- Optimal Trials: 50
- Optimal Seeds: 20
- Coefficient of Variation: 1.2877
- Mean RMSE: 579.3749
- Total Evaluations: 1000

COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY:
- Total Compute Time: 10875.6 seconds
- Average Time per Evaluation: 4.35 seconds
- Throughput: 0.2 evaluations/second

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FULL MODEL EVALUATION:

1. PROXY-BASED RECOMMENDATION:
   - Use 50 trials and 20 seeds for all models
   - Expected stability: CV ≈ 1.2877
   - Computational cost per model: ~1000 evaluations
   - Use the same random seed generation approach (master_seed=42)

2. CONFIDENCE LEVEL: Medium
   - LSTM_Config2 showed improving performance
   - Random seed correlations eliminated
   - Other models likely to follow similar convergence patterns
   - Consider validation with 1-2 additional models if critical

3. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
   - Start with recommended parameters for full hyperparameter search
   - Use the improved random seed generation method
   - Monitor early results for consistency with proxy analysis
   - Adjust if other models show significantly different behavior
